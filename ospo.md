The __Open Source Programme Office__ (OSPO) was founded as a team within it@M on the basis of the City Council motion ['Establish Open Source Hub and Open Source Sabbatical'](https://risi.muenchen.de/risi/sitzungsvorlage/detail/7532900) (2023-02-15).

The Open Source Programme Office aims to coordinate and promote open source activities at LHM in line with the IT strategy.  
The two dimensions "give" and "take" are taken into account, i.e. both the use of open source software and the publication and release of LHM's own software developments as open source ("public money - public code").


## Tasks

The tasks of the [team](#team) are:

* Identifying relevant communities and solutions: Actively screen and explore [open source projects](./use) and communities working on solutions relevant to LHM. Relevance is assessed on the basis of the architectural categorisation of open source.
* Shaping relationships with [external communities](#extern).
* Establishment, management and coordination of a [city-internal open source community](#lhm-community) by an employee of the Open Source Programme Office in the role of Community Manager.
* Clarification of [licence issues](./licenses) and regulation of the licensing of LHM open source publications.
* Identify and bring about the clarification of legal issues and support the application of a legal open source publication guide. 
* Appropriate synchronisation of activities with activities of the Federal Government, the Free State Bavaria and other [local authorities](#extern) on the subject of open source (e.g. ZenDiS, OpenCode).
* Evaluation and prioritisation of ideas and initiatives on open source in the LHM in order to invest resources in a focused manner.
* Managing LHM's presence on public open source platforms, in particular on public [code repositories](./repositories) (examples: github.com, gitlab.com). The aim is to ensure standardised and consistent communication and an image that complies with the legal framework.
* Development of methodological aids and provision of expertise for colleagues who [develop open source software](./publish) for the LHM, especially if the development itself takes place on public code repositories such as github.com. (Examples: Methodology for integrating such software into the LHM IT environment).
* Development, consolidation and provision (e.g. via intranet) of expertise and awareness on the subject of open source.
* Organisation and implementation of the [Open Source Sabbatical](./sabbatical).

### External communities and other authorities {#extern}

When shaping relationships with external communities and public actors in Bavaria, Germany, and the European Union, we approach existing groups and contribute our expertise and strategic input.

* [Open Source Business Alliance (OSBA)](https://osb-alliance.de/mitglied/it-anwender-oeffentliche-verwaltung)
* We are a founding member of the [Municipal Open Source Board](https://os-board.opencode.de/) of ZenDiS, KGSt, and the City of Dortmund.


### Municipal Open Source Community {#lhm-community}

Software is always created by a large number of participants.Free software is also always the result of collaboration between developers, users, and many others.
The __Municipal Open Source Community__ is an open group in which all LHM employees can participate.

Communication takes place via an internal open chat group, and the community meets every two weeks to exchange news on the topic of open source.

The municipal open source community also takes on technical (e.g. [usability analyses](usability-analysis), [contributions](improve#code-contributions)) and specialist tasks (e.g. [supervision feature funding](improve#feature-funding), [honorary patron sponsorship](sponsoring#honorary-patron)).
These are managed together with the tasks of the OSPO.


### Procurement consulting

The OSPO offers advice on new software solutions (procurements, replacements, smaller solutions or infrastructure).

* Market research on open source solutions, especially from the municipal sector.
* If features, bug fixes or other (e.g. security analyses) are necessary, we help with the technical or organisational implementation.
* Cooperation if there is no practicable open source solution.

The OSPO only offers advisory assistance, not tender implementation or make-buy-use-compose analyses (MBUC).

## Team

In addition to numerous developers from the urban open source community, who contribute ideas, passion and, above all, public code, take care of open source:

Klaus 'klml' Mueller is Head of the OSPO of the City of Munich, which was founded in 2024.
Before that, he and his team built the Kubernetes Platform, a world in which FOSS is already standard.
Klaus has been a stable FOSS enthusiast since Linux kernel 2.6.0.
