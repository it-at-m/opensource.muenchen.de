# Open Source in the Munich City Administration

In [Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), the source code is public and can be viewed, modified and used by third parties.
The City of Munich uses open source software for many reasons.


## Strategic advantages

* Through open source software, we increase __vendor independence__. By being able to switch vendors and solutions, we can avoid unilateral dictation of function or price by the vendor.
* The __reuse__ of software is facilitated. Code that is made open source can be easily reused by other agencies or public sector IT providers without contractual agreements or financial arrangements. This can save taxpayer money.
* __Cooperations__ with other government agencies or public sector IT providers are easily possible. This allows LHM to achieve its goals with less budget.
* Publicly available code can be easily reviewed for __security vulnerabilities__. Moreover, security vulnerabilities can be closed without the vendor. This is also the strategic position of the [BSI](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Informationen-und-Empfehlungen/Freie-Software/freie-software.html), as well as the [AG KRITIS](https://ag.kritis.info/politische-forderungen/#opensource).
* The __transparency__ about the software and its development creates trust in the population towards the administration.
* Committed citizens can participate in __projects__ and thus contribute innovative ideas and reduce the required municipal budget. 
* Public Code generates positive public relations and contributes to our [recruitment marketing for IT professionals](https://karriere.muenchen.de/search/?optionsFacetsDD_customfield3=Informationstechnologie+%28IT%29+%26+Telekommunikation).

## Legal and political requirements

In addition to the benefits of open source software for us as an IT service provider, we also comply with legal and political requirements.

The city council elected in March 2020 has taken a clear and sustainable position on the topic of open source:

> Open Source Lösungen sollen verstärkt zum Einsatz kommen und werden als eine der Maßnahmen zur Stärkung digitaler Souveränität identifiziert.[^koalitionsvertrag_2020]

> Open source solutions are to be increasingly used and are identified as one of the measures for strengthening digital sovereignty.[^koalitionsvertrag_2020].

An important step towards integrating the topic of open source into the orientation of IT was the inclusion of the topic in the [strategic orientation of LHM's IT](https://www.muenchen-transparent.de/dokumente/6229564) adopted by the City Council on 11.11.2020:


> __3.6. Die IT der LHM setzt priorisiert Open Source-Lösungen ein, wenn wirtschaftlich und technologisch oder strategisch sinnvoll.__
> Wenn wirtschaftlich und technologisch oder strategisch sinnvoll, setzt die LHM priorisiert Open Source-Lösungen ein, um insbesondere Firmenabhängigkeiten zu vermeiden.
> Die LHM verfolgt diesen Ansatz sowohl im Anwendungs- als auch im Infrastruktur-Bereich.
> Die IT der LHM stellt Eigenentwicklungen, die frei von Rechten Dritter sind, als Open Source der Community zur Verfügung.

> __3.6 LHM IT prioritizes the use of open source solutions when economically and technologically or strategically appropriate.__
> If economically and technologically or strategically sensible, LHM prioritizes the use of open source solutions, in particular to avoid company dependencies.
> LHM pursues this approach in both the application and infrastructure areas.
> LHM's IT makes proprietary developments that are free of third-party rights available to the community as open source.

The [Bavarian Digital Act - BayDiG Art. 3 Para.4 Sentence 1](https://www.gesetze-bayern.de/Content/Document/BayDiG-3) also obliges us to use open software:


> Die Behörden des Freistaates Bayern sollen bei Neuanschaffungen offene Software verwenden und offene Austauschstandards nutzen, soweit dies wirtschaftlich und zweckmäßig ist

> The authorities of the Free State of Bavaria shall use open software in new acquisitions and shall use open exchange standards insofar as this is economical and expedient


## Standard

Free software is also becoming the standard in modern software development.

Other local authorities like the cities of [Berlin](https://berlinopensource.de/warum-open-source/) or [Dortmund](https://blog.do-foss.de/) use and contribute to open source.

Commercial companies are also participating in free software.
These are traditionally software companies (e.g. [SAP](https://opensource.sap.com), [Zalando](https://opensource.zalando.com), [Google](https://opensource.google/), [Microsoft](https://opensource.microsoft.com/), [Apple](https://opensource.apple.com)) but also companies that do not come from the software industry (e.g. [Deutsche Bahn](https://opensource.deutschebahn.com), [Mercedes Benz](https://opensource.mercedes-benz.com/) oder [Siemens](https://opensource.siemens.com)).


## IT architecture classification

In highly standardized IT areas such as operating systems, network components, databases and end devices, IT architecture relies on the standard solutions of the IT market. This serves to ensure that only those paths are taken which do not prove to be wrong paths or dead ends a few years later. Often, due to the large market, the greatest innovative power is concentrated in the standard solutions, since this is where most resources are invested. Thus, open source solutions are not necessarily used here, but in many areas open source solutions have become established as the standard, and are therefore also used by default at the City of Munich. One example is Linux as the operating system for servers.

Especially in the area of municipal software we are often challenged [to develop free software ourselves](./publish).
