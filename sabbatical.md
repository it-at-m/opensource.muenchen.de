The prerequisite is the consent of the department that is assigning the employee.

## Sabbaticals

### [Integreat-Chat](software/integreat#open-source-sabbatical)

The first Open Source Sabbatical in the first half of 2025 was awarded to the [integreat-chat](software/integreat#open-source-sabbatical) project in order to integrate a multilingual chat service into the Integreat App. This service is intended to be available around the clock for people seeking advice in Munich.

By using Llama 3.3 and Google Gemma 3, effective communication is ensured, capable of responding to both simple and complex queries. The entire software is open source, and the source code is publicly available on GitHub.

The project’s results so far are promising: in roughly 50% of cases, the chatbot provides helpful and appropriate responses to queries. Translation quality has been rated at 4.9 out of 5, while answer quality is rated at 4.0 out of 5. Additionally, the relevance of linked content has been rated at 4.8 out of 5. The consistently positive feedback from users shows that the chatbot not only makes the Integreat App more interactive but also provides real added value for the integration and support of people with a migration background.

This sabbatical also places emphasis on usability and accessibility to ensure that all Munich residents, regardless of their background or language skills, can make the best possible use of the advantages of the Integreat App.
