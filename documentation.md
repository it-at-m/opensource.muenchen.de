# Documentation of Open Source Software

Comprehensive documentation is essential for any software, especially for open source software that is intended to be used or modified by others. Clear and detailed documentation in the source code is a fundamental prerequisite for ensuring the accessibility and usability of the software.

## Structure of the Documentation

To ensure effective documentation, the following elements are required:

### README.md

Every repository must contain a `README.md` file in the root directory. This file should include all sections of the [OSS Repository Template](https://github.com/it-at-m/oss-repository-en-template/blob/main/README.md).  
**Important:** The `README.md` file must be written in English to reach a wider audience of open source enthusiasts worldwide and to avoid language barriers.

A README aims to answer the following questions:

* What does this project do?
* Why is it useful?
* How can I use it or contribute to it?
* Where can I get help if I need assistance?


### Documentation Folder `/docs`

Technical documentation can be thematically structured and stored in the `/docs` folder. This folder can also serve as the basis for a website. The technical documentation should preferably be written in an "English First" approach to ensure international comprehensibility.

### Website

For larger projects or multi-repositories, a documentation website can be created under a subdomain of `*.oss.muenchen.de` (e.g., [digiwf.oss.muenchen.de](https://digiwf.oss.muenchen.de)).  
The entire `muenchen.de` domain is verified on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/organizations/it-at-m/settings/pages), which applies to all projects.  
To create a project website, the subdomain can be configured in the respective project repository for GitHub Pages.
A user manual or general product documentation should ideally be available in both German and English.

## Challenges in Documentation

Creating and maintaining documentation can be challenging. It requires time and must be updated regularly to reflect changes in the software. Insufficient or outdated documentation can lead to errors, higher support costs, and a shortened product lifecycle. Therefore, it is crucial that developers do not underestimate the importance of documentation.

## Best Practices for Effective Documentation

To improve documentation quality and foster an inclusive community, the following best practices should be followed:

1. **Common terminology:** Consistent definitions and use of terms improve communication within the community.  
2. **Contribution guidelines:** Clear guidelines make it easier for users to contribute to the documentation.  
3. **Documentation templates:** Templates help capture information consistently.  
4. **Documenting new features:** Each new or updated feature should be documented to make it easier for users to apply.  
5. **Regular reviews:** Content should be reviewed and updated at least quarterly to ensure relevance.

By implementing these measures, the documentation of open source software can be significantly improved, leading to greater user satisfaction and a vibrant, inclusive community.  
Effective documentation not only benefits users but also contributes to the long-term success of the project.
