**Integreat** is a local and multilingual integration platform for immigrants that can be used in any municipality without the involvement of the IT department.

---

LHM has been using Integreat as a software-as-a-service since February 2020.
The Integreat Munich platform provides refugees and new immigrants with multilingual initial information to help them arrive in Munich and welcome them - both via the free and offline Integreat app (download via Google Play Store or App Store) and at [integreat.app/muenchen/](https://integreat.app/muenchen/).
The overview of Munich's offerings is also a great help for full-time staff and volunteers.

## Open Source Sabbatical

Integreat has already received the [Munich Innovation Award 2024 for the Digital Welcome Center](https://stadt.muenchen.de/news/innovationspreis-muenchen2024.html#id2).
In addition, we have awarded the first [Open Source Sabbatical](../sabbatical) in the first half of 2025 to the [integreat-chat](https://github.com/digitalfabrik/integreat-chat) project to integrate a chat service into the Integreat app.

The integreat-chat uses a large language model to answer questions based on the content of the Integreat app.
For incoming requests, the system generates suggested answers for the human agents in our [Zammad](zammad).

The integreat-chat is currently in beta phase and answers questions with a success rate of over 50%. About 40% of the inquiries were too specific for the chat, requiring responses from human agents.

In May 2025, 12 people were once again surveyed in the waiting area of the [Integration counselling (IBZ - language and career)](https://stadt.muenchen.de/service/en-GB/info/abteilung-migration-integration-teilhabe/10426703/) to test the chatbot. The participants asked their own questions and then rated the responses, translations, and linked content. The translations received an average rating of 4.9 out of 5 points, the responses 4 out of 5 stars, and the linked content 4.8 out of 5 points.
