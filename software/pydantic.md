__Pydantic__ is the de-facto standard data validation library for [Python](python), with a focus on data integrity and type safety.
It integrates with linters and IDEs, is fast and extensible, and uses standard Python type hints for defining data models.

---

We use Pydantic in combination with other frameworks like [LangChain](langchain) or [FastAPI](fastapi), or for typesafe payload definitions and parsing in data processing pipelines.
