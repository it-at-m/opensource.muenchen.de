**Graylog** is a platform for central log management, the collection, analysis and visualization of log data.

---

Graylog enables us to collect data from various servers and to aggregate, process and analyze it centrally.
We operate two instances.
One central instance for 120 services with 50GB and 140 million log entries per day
And an extra instance for IAM 40GB and an average of 50 million log entries per day.

As we operate Graylog on-prem, we can also use it for services that have the highest data protection requirements.
