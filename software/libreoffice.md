This includes programs for word processing, spreadsheets, presentations and creating drawings.
LibreOffice was used as an office package as part of Limux until the end of 2023.

During our use of LibreOffice, we have contributed numerous bug fixes, functional improvements and further developments.
Our LHM LibreOffice versions were first contributed to [The Document Foundation](https://www.documentfoundation.org/) (_TDF_) LibreOffice main branch, went through quality assurance there and were only ported back to our LibreOffice after approval by quality assurance.
This was an advantage for both LHM and TDF:
We were able to use the TDF quality assurance and our commits/contributions are also included in the current TDF LibreOffice.

In addition, we have handed over the letterhead and form system [Wollmux](https://wollmux.org), which was founded by the City of Munich, to the TDF for further development.
It will be continued there under the name [LibreOffice Template System - LOTS](https://github.com/LibreOffice/lots/).
