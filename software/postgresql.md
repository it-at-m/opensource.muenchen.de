__PostgreSQL__ is a free, object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

In order to focus on one technology, PostgreSQL has been preferred as the default database system for new use cases since 2024.
With PostgreSQL, we use a stable and established database system that, above all, allows us to be vendor-independent.
Other database systems can only be used in technically justified exceptions.

Together with [MariaDB](mariadb), which is also free, around 40% of our database instances currently use an open source database system.
