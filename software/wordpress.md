**WordPress** is the most used free content management system (CMS) on the [Internet](https://trends.builtwith.com/cms).

For example, [pi-muenchen.de](https://www.pi-muenchen.de), [gemeinsam-fuer-das-klima.de](https://gemeinsam-fuer-das-klima.de), [pflege-in-muenchen.de](https://pflege-in-muenchen.de), [muenchen-unser-kindl.de](https://muenchen-unser-kindl.de) or [digital-at-m.de](https://digital-at-m.de) use Wordpress.

The event registration [veranstaltungen.muenchen.de](https://veranstaltungen.muenchen.de) was realized with the plugins "Events Manager" and "Events Manager Pro".
This is used to organize the booking of free events such as the program for the holiday/family pass, but also the almost 600 training dates for the election workers\* of the local election.
