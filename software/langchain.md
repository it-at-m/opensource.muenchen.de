__LangChain__ is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

---

We use LangChain as core library inside [MUCGPT](mucgpt) as well as other LLM-based applications currently in development.
Next to the [Python](python) Library, we also make use of [LangServe](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langserve/) and [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/), which are part of the LangChain ecosystem.
