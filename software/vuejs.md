__Vue.js__ is a client-side JavaScript web framework for building single-page web applications following the MVVM pattern, but it can also be used in multipage web pages for single sections.

In our reference architecture, Vue.js, along with [Vuetify](./vuetifyjs), is used for almost all [in-house developments](../publish.html), which is why we [sponsor](../improve.html#sponsoring) [Vue.js as a gold sponsor](https://vuejs.org/sponsor/#gold).
