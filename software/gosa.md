In cooperation with FAI (Fully Automatic Installation), GOsa² allows the automated installation of pre-configured systems. Via GOto extensions complete workstations can be managed up to the pre-configuration of applications, the assignment of rights as well as the presetting of start menus. GOsa² is based on LDAP, i.e. it allows the administration of users, systems and related parameters.
