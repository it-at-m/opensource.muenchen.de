Startercode is a [code generator of the Canton of Zurich](https://github.com/openZH/startercode-generator_openZH) and generates a Python and R script "framework" with the most important metadata and the corresponding lines of code to quickly start the data analysis.
We have adapted the model from Zurich to the Open Data Portal Munich.

We [generate](https://github.com/it-at-m/startercode-generator-munich) the Startercode regularly on github and publish it on [it-at-m.github.io/startercode-opendata-munich/](https://it-at-m.github.io/startercode-opendata-munich/)
