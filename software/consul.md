[Consul](https://consuldemocracy.org) is a free software for citizen participation.

---

Consul was originally founded by the city of Madrid.

In 2019 [the Munich City Council](https://www.muenchen-transparent.de/antraege/5651290) initiated the platform for digital citizen participation [unser.muenchen.de](https://unser.muenchen.de).
Munich uses a version modified for Munich by [demokratie.today](https://demokratie.today).

In order to continue to ensure high quality, we sponsor [Consul as Ambassador Sponsor](https://consuldemocracy.org/2024/09/welcoming-our-first-official-project-sponsor/).
