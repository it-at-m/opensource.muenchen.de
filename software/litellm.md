__LiteLLM__ provides a gateway to access multiple large language models (LLMs) and other AI models via an unified API.
It allows usage tracking, caching and access control and provides a web based UI for administration, monitoring and testing of the models.

We use LiteLLM to provide a single entry point for all AI model requests in our self-built AI applications like [MUCGPT](mucgpt) as well as existing applications that integrate with our AI models.
