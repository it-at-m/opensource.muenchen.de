__Vuetify__ is a UI library for Vue components in [Material Design](https://m3.material.io).
In the reference architecture, Vuetify is used for almost all [custom development](../publish).

---

Just like with [Vue.js](./vuejs), we benefit massively from the work of the community.
To ensure the continued high quality of Vuetify, we sponsor [Vuetify as a Platinum Sponsor](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/introduction/sponsors-and-backers/#platinum) with [$500 per month](https://www.muenchen-transparent.de/dokumente/7347900).
