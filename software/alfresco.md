The cooperation platform __Alfresco__ offers the possibility of cooperation with external parties, e.g. in the context of committee work (district committees) or with engineering firms.

The collaboration takes place in virtual project rooms. In these, files can be exchanged, appointments can be made or texts can be jointly written.
