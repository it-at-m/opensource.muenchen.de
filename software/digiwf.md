__DigiWF__ is a platform for process automation. Users can automate workflows themselves and access other systems.

---


## About the project

Since 2019, the topic of process automation has been pushed forward in the Munich City Administration.
For this purpose, the Camunda BPMN Process Engine is used, which the project DigiWF uses.
This provides users* with a platform that enables them to create automated workflows themselves via a modular building block concept.

The platform ensures that tasks in a business process are processed in the right order and that the necessary information is available digitally in the right place.
In addition, DigiWF also provides metrics on workflow executions, supporting continuous process improvement.

## Technical details

Large parts of the platform are based on the [camunda BPM platform](https://camunda.com/platform/).
DigiWF can be used with both the free open source version and the paid enterprise version of Camunda.
For the City of Munich, we use the licensed enterprise version, as this allows us to use extended functions and tools, such as Cockpit and Optimize, which offer us added value in the creation and operation of end-to-end processes.
DigiWF (or Camunda) also works with the [free version](https://camunda.com/pricing/) of Camunda.
Especially for small and less complex processes, this is a good way to work with the platform without major hurdles.

The front end is based on the form framework of the reference architecture of the state capital.
The workflows run in the backend, where [Kafka](kafka), the camunda workflow and the camunda rule engine are used as the basis.
