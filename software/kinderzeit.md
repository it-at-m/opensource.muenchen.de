## About the project


In the context of this project, a challenge of the Munich City Council was worked on in collaboration with the [Digital Product School](https://www.digitalproductschool.io) of UnternehmerTUM.

To support families, a way to provide information for activities during school vacations with planning and booking functions was to be found.

The functional prototype was developed by an international team during a three-month full-time program, with the participation of the InnovationLab in the IT department in the form of an interaction designer.

## Technical details

After extensive user research in advance, the team decided to develop the digital vacation planner as a web application. For this purpose, user needs were first implemented as a high-fidelity prototype in Figma and then tested. According to the feedback of the testers, the prototype was adapted if necessary and tested again or integrated piece by piece into the product.

Through weekly user tests throughout the entire program, the product was constantly developed further in iterative cycles and a high level of user satisfaction was achieved.
