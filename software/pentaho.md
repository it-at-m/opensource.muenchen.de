Pentaho is a collection of business intelligence software that is open source in a basic version.

The City of Munich uses the Pentaho Desktop App as a reporting tool and the Pentaho Carte Server.
The __Pentaho Carte Server__ is part of the Pentaho Data Integration platform for capturing, blending, cleansing and preparing various data from any source in any environment without code.
We use this as a [container image](https://github.com/it-at-m/pentaho-carte) in our in-house development [Information System for Social Infrastructure Planning (ISI)](./isi.html).
