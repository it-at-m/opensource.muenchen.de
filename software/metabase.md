Metabase is an open-source business intelligence tool that allows users to extract and transform data from various sources to make informed decisions.

---

Metabase supports various data sources like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Microsoft SQL Server, and many more. Metabase provides a simple user interface that is easy to understand even for non-technical users. It enables users to perform complex data analysis and identify trends and patterns in the data to make informed decisions.

The LHM utilizes Metabase, among other tools, to conduct analyses of the offerings and their usage in the [educational facilities of the Pedagogical Institute](https://www.pi-muenchen.de/beratung-und-bildungslokale/). Additionally, the LHM provides support for the municipal providers, particularly in monitoring and managing the occupancy control process in the childcare centers. Another objective is the general controlling of the authorizations for specialist procedures, which is carried out for all relevant specialist procedures of the [Department for Education and Sports](https://stadt.muenchen.de/en/rathaus/verwaltung/referat-bildung-sport.html), taking into account the role management via Active Directory.
