dbt enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications.
    
---

Analysts using dbt can transform their data by simply writing select statements, while dbt handles turning these statements into tables and views in a data warehouse.

These select statements, or "models", form a dbt project. Models frequently build on top of one another – dbt makes it easy to manage relationships between models, and visualize these relationships, as well as assure the quality of your transformations through testing.
