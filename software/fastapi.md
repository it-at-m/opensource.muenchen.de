__FastAPI__ is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with [Python](python), based on standard Python type hints.
It supports asynchronous traffic by default and is designed to be easy to use and learn, while also being highly performant, scalable and with low code footprint.
FastAPI uses [Pydantic](pydantic) for data validation and parsing.

We use FastAPI to build and deploy the backends our AI-based Python applications like [MUCGPT](mucgpt), as it allows us to quickly create APIs with automatic interactive documentation and validation.
Furthermore, other components like [LangChain](langchain) automatically integrate with FastAPI.
