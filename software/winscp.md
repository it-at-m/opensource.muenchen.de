WinSCP is a program for transferring data securely.

---

WinSCP allows synchronizing two directories, so that, for example, the files on a client can be synchronized with those on a server. In addition, the tool includes the usual functions of a file manager for copying, deleting or moving data. If required, the information of a session can be saved.
