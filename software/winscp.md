WinSCP is a program for transferring data securely.

---

WinSCP allows synchronizing two directories, so that, for example, the files on a client can be synchronized with those on a server. In addition, the tool includes the usual functions of a file manager for copying, deleting or moving data. If required, the information of a session can be saved.

To implement specific requirements for WinSCP, LHM 2025 sponsored WinSCP with the amount of â‚¬2000. The implemented feature enables displaying and editing S3 tags in WinSCP, thus benefiting other users as well.
