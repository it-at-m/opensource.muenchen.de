Matomo (formerly Piwik) web tracking is used to analyze user behavior of a web application.

---

We use Matomo to track external websites as well as internal systems, ensuring that sensitive tracking information is only stored on municipal infrastructure.

To meet all internal requirements of the various stakeholders in all departments, we use the Opencore feature [Premium Bundle _Unlimited users unlimited websites_](https://plugins.matomo.org/PremiumBundle).
