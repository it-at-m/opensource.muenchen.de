Inclus offers an overview of all accessible, (semi) public toilets in Munich by means of a map.

---

## About the project

The web map application [inclus](https://inclus.de) provides people with disabilities with an overview of all (semi-) public, barrier-free toilets and their equipment.

If one selects a toilet by clicking on the map, detailed information is displayed such as:

* floor plan
* installed handles
* door width
* slope of the ramp
* use with or without Euro key

In addition, the guests themselves have the possibility to leave an evaluation of the condition of the toilet.

## Technical details

The application was developed in collaboration with the [Digital Product School](https://www.digitalproductschool.io) of UnternehmerTUM and is currently being prototyped there. The data basis was created by the Club Behinderter und ihrer Freunde e.V. and made available to the project.
