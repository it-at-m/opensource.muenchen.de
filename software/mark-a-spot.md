**Mark-a-Spot** is a platform for openly dealing with infrastructure problems (deficiency reporting) and participation procedures in public space.

Concern Management is a transparent, online communication interface between citizens and the city administration. Here, concerns about pollution and damage in Munich's cityscape can be reported and answered. The reports are submitted via an online reporting platform called [Mach MÃ¼nchen besser](https://machmuenchenbesser.de)!

In order to offer citizens a simple, digital way to send reports to the city administration, such as defective lighting or garbage scattered around collection bins, a new platform "machmuenchenbesser.de" was put into operation in 2021. It is based on the open source platform Mark-a-Spot and with it more than 1000 concerns have already been processed since September 2021.

Mark-a-Spot is an extension for the free framework [Drupal](drupal).
