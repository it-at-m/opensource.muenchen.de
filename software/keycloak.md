__Keycloak__ is an open source software product that enables single sign-on with identity and access management for modern applications and services.

The IT building guidelines for digital identities stipulate that digital identities, regardless of whether they concern employees or citizens, are always stored in the company's own data center and managed with Keycloak.

The connection of specialist procedures to BayernID was implemented via the Keycloak brokering mechanism [BayernID - Plugin](bayernid-plugin).
Keycloak is also the technical basis for [Elster Nezo, a plugin for connecting the Elster company account](elster-nezo_plugin).
