__CKAN__ (Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network) is a web-based data catalog software used especially by public institutions for sharing "open data", which is further developed by the [OKFN](https://okfn.org).
We use CKAN in two projects:

The portal [opendata.muenchen.de](https://opendata.muenchen.de) publishes the open data offered by the state capital of Munich and offers it in a wide variety of visualizations.

As part of the [Connected Urban Twins](https://www.connectedurbantwins.de) project (CUT), Munich is developing the digital twin together with Hamburg and Leipzig.
The development of the projects is user-oriented and modular.
[All project results are shared at an early stage and made available as "open source"](https://stadt.muenchen.de/infos/connected-urban-twins.html), as stipulated by the [Regulations on Open Source for Model Projects Smart Cities of the Federal Ministry of Housing, Urban Development and Construction ](https://www.smart-city-dialog.de/regelungen-zu-open-source-fuer-modellprojekte-smart-cities).
