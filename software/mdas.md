In the MDAS project, the EAI components for data import and export and the web application for controlling all incoming and outgoing interfaces for the central mobility data platform (MobidaM) are being developed.

---

In the MDAS project, the MobidaM platform is being created, which can be used to provide, store, visualize and evaluate mobility data.
A wide variety of data from various internal or external data sources such as the [Mobilithek des Bundes](https://www.bmdv.bund.de/DE/Themen/Digitales/Mobilithek/mobilithek.html) is collected and also shared with other public platforms.

The project was initiated by the city council resolution [Central data platform for mobility data
MDAS - Monitoring and Data Analytics System](https://www.muenchen-transparent.de/antraege/7983679)
