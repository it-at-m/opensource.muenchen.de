GitLab is a devops and software development platform.

---

We use GitLab as a platform for version management, CI/CD and as a project management tool.

It manages software from software projects that have not yet been published and the CI/CD code from [in-house development](../publish).
These are imported into our infrastructure as [Helmchart incl. container image](../repositories#artifacts) and rolled out with Gitlab.
Numerous external software is also rolled out with Gitlab.
