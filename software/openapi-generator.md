**OpenAPI Generator** enables the automatic generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs, documentation and configuration based on an OpenAPI specification.
The OpenAPI specification is a standard for describing HTTP programming interfaces (APIs), which can also be used to define REST-compliant interfaces.

LHM offers numerous IT services and we link these services with each other on the basis of standardized interface protocols.
The OpenAPI specification enables us to define and technically document interfaces ourselves, but also in cooperation with external manufacturers.
Using the OpenAPI Generator, we generate clients or server components based on these definitions, thereby accelerating our development process.
