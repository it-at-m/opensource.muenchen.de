The [GeoPortal](https://geoportal.muenchen.de/portal/master/) provides basic spatial information such as an official city map, addresses and aerial photographs, or the "Potential of near-surface geothermal energy."

### About the project

Almost all application scenarios of a smart city, from digital city maps to intelligent traffic control, are based on the central availability of geoinformation and corresponding interfaces through which this data can be integrated into digital services. With the GeoPortal Munich, precisely this geoinformation and services are made available in a user-friendly way to users from business, science, administration - and not least to the citizens themselves: quickly, reliably and digitally.

The city-wide platform has already been online since December 2018 and supports numerous online services of the state capital with basic spatial information such as an official city map, addresses and aerial photographs. Specialist topics from the city's departments can build on this. In this way, a variety of thematic content is possible and correlations can be seen quickly and at a glance.

The GeoPortal mainly uses open source software (OSS). Particularly mentioned here is the so-called master portal as a map client. This software is being developed together with other authorities as part of an implementation partnership. The state capital of Munich is a founding member of this partnership, along with the Hanseatic City of Hamburg. Since then, major metropolises from the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) as well as some federal states and authorities of the federal administration have joined. Thus, it is possible to benefit from the experience as well as the know-how of other partner organizations in many places in order to generate joint advantages and to develop more speed in the implementation.
The GeoPortal is the spatial data infrastructure on which the [Digital Twin Munich](https://muenchen.digital/twin/) is based.

### Architecture

Today, modern, scalable software does not consist of a monolithic piece of code, but is instead composed of modular components that can be installed individually and exchanged as required, and that communicate with each other via open, standardized interfaces as far as possible.
communicate with each other. As in the case of the master portal example mentioned above, all
components are based on free software and are themselves provided as free software by active and internationally recognized communities in the geodata field.

- The map service software [Geoserver](https://geoserver.org) with the OGC compliant web services.
- The metadata catalog [GeoNetwork](https://geonetwork-opensource.org) with also OGC compliant web services with harvesting to and from other metadata catalogs.
- Fraunhofer IOSB's [FROST server for sensor data](https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/de/projekte-produkte/frostserver.html) is an implementation of the [SensorThings standard](https://www.ogc.org/standards/sensorthings) of the [Open Geospatial Consortium](https://www.ogc.org/) (OGC).
- The free database PostgreSQL has become a standard, the GeoPortal also uses PostgreSQL and the extension [PostGIS](https://postgis.net), which was developed especially for geodata.
- [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/de/elasticsearch/) as a search engine.
- With [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) we convert different types of data (for example sensor data) into the standard

### What have we contributed?

So we use a rich source of IT services here, but we also contribute to the care & maintenance and further development at the master portal by being an active member in the [Implementation Partnership](https://www.masterportal.org/maintainer-group.html), and also contribute financially to the [Development Fund](https://www.masterportal.org/entwicklungsfonds.html).

In total, we as LHM support the Masterportal with 10.000 â‚¬/year (net) of tax money.
