**OpenStreetMap** is a free project that collects and structures freely usable geodata, maintains it as open data and provides online maps.

The City of Munich uses OpenStreetMap as a map source for areas outside the city limits in its [Geoportal](geoportal.html).
But other applications such as [Kitafinder](https://kitafinder.muenchen.de/elternportal/de/einrichtungen/karte/ergebnisse) or [muenchen-mitdenken.de](https://muenchen-mitdenken.de/) also use OpenStreetMap.

The LHM provides official aerial photographs with a high-quality resolution of 20 cm for the creation of maps [available](https://github.com/osmlab/editor-layer-index/blob/gh-pages/sources/europe/de/AktuelleLuftbilderDerLandeshauptstadtMuenchen20cm.geojson?short_path=cdc4d8a) to OpenStreetMap for map creation.
We also encourage all employees to contribute relevant city data to Openstreetmap.
For example, the [MÃ¼nchner Stadtbibliothek](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/M%C3%BCnchner%20Stadtbibliothek) account independently ensures that all district branches and their opening hours are correct.
