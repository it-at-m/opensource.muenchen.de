Grafana is a powerful tool for visualizing performance data, used by the City of Munich (LHM) for various applications. By integrating specific plugins, such as those for NetApp or OpenShift, performance data from storage systems can be represented efficiently.

The Department of Urban Development and Building Regulation in Munich utilizes Grafana to create dashboards that visually present important data related to urban development and the housing market. Examples can be found on the Connected Urban Twins website: [Innovative Urban Development - Housing Market Observation Munich](https://www.connectedurbantwins.de/wissenstransfer/cut-akademie/innovative-stadtentwicklung-wohnungsmarktbeobachtung-muenchen/) or under [Housing Market Data Munich](https://stadt.muenchen.de/rathaus/daten-fakten/statistik/wohnungsmarktdaten.html).
