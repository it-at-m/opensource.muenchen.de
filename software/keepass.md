Keepass2 is a password management system for use on local and personal devices.

We use various measures to protect ourselves against computer crime.
In addition to two-factor authentication for particularly sensitive services, unique and securely stored user IDs are an important factor.
The City of Munich is therefore rolling out Keepass2 on all workstation computers to enable secure password management for all employees.

In system administration in particular, we use Keepass to independently secure central infrastructure components, such as virtualisation, without being dependent on directory services.
