**CollectiveAccess** is free, open-source software for cataloguing and publishing museum and archival collections.

---

CollectiveAccess has been in use as an internal catalog at the [Münchner Stadtmuseum](https://www.muenchner-stadtmuseum.de/), the [Lenbachhaus](https://www.lenbachhaus.de/), the [Valentin-Karlstadt-Musäum](https://www.valentin-karlstadt-musaeum.de/), the [Villa Stuck](https://www.villastuck.de/), the [Jewish Museum Munich](https://www.juedisches-museum-muenchen.de/) and others since around 2015.
The Munich City Museum alone uses CollectiveAccess to manage over 200,000 objects with 50 terabytes of data.

In order to incorporate our wishes and requirements into CollectiveAccess, we commission the developers directly with 10 to 30 person-days per year.
