**Robot Framework** is a generic automation framework that can be used for both test automation and robotic process automation.

---

The possibilities for integration into our system landscape through open interfaces are important for LHM.
Robot Framework is used for various tasks:

- with a plugin, Robot Framework is integrated into [Checkmk](checkmk), which is also free, and enables, for example, browser tests to be called up directly in Checkmk and the test results to be displayed in Checkmk.
- as a test framework in the [Digital Twin](https://muenchen.digital/projekte/digitaler-zwilling.html).
- as an automatic tool for Windows client installation as well as for regression tests after BIOS updates.

Through our membership of the [Robot Framework Foundation](https://robotframework.org/foundation/#what-we-do), we ensure that the Robot Framework is continuously maintained and further developed.
We have a direct influence on the decision-making process during project development and can therefore ensure that the framework meets our requirements.
In addition, we have official contact with the developers in the event of technical problems or feature requests.
