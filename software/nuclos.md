**Nuclos** is a free enterprise resource planning software that we at it@M use to manage our entire internal IT portfolio and resource planning.

We use Nuclos in our data center and have agreed an [hourly quota offered by the manufacturer](https://www.nuclos.de/support/).
This allows us to call on developers to support us in the development of internal service offerings.
