Internal and external services are operated on the Kubernetes platform __Openshift__.

---

[New in-house developments](../publish) are always developed for Kubernetes and Openshift.
This enables us, but also subsequent users, to operate the applications easily. 

The following Opensource applications are operated by us on Openshift:


<ClientOnly>
<TagTile
:available-tags="['k8s']"
show-excerpt
/>
</ClientOnly>

<script setup>
import TagTile from "../.vitepress/components/TagTile.vue";
</script>
