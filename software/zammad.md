Zammad is a free helpdesk and issue tracking system that enables the connection of various channels such as e-mail and telephone.

---

Zammad is used in the digital citizen service for less structured processes.
Citizens can submit requests on the municipal form server (e.g. [form for technical enquiries](https://service.muenchen.de/intelliform/forms/01/01/01/supportformular/index)) in a legally secure manner.
City employees can then process the process in Zammad.
Citizens can then finally view the response at [stadt.muenchen.de BÃ¼rgerservice Mein Anliegen](https://stadt.muenchen.de/buergerservice/anliegen/detailAnliegen.html).
