Zammad is a free helpdesk and issue tracking system that enables the connection of various channels such as e-mail and telephone.

Zammad is used in the digital citizen service for less structured processes.
Citizens can submit requests on the municipal form server (e.g. [form for technical enquiries](https://service.muenchen.de/intelliform/forms/01/01/01/supportformular/index)) in a legally secure manner.
City employees can then process the process in Zammad.
Citizens can then finally view the response at [digital citizen service](https://stadt.muenchen.de/buergerservice/anliegen/detailAnliegen.html).

Since citizens can log in to both the municipal form server and the digital citizen service via our [BayernId-plugin](./bayernid-plugin.html) at [BayernID](https://id.bayernportal.de/de/), we can also offer citizen services with a [high level of trust](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Oeffentliche-Verwaltung/eIDAS-Verordnung/Elektronische-Identifizierung/elektronische-identifizierung_node.html).

The [zammad-ldap-sync](https://github.com/it-at-m/zammad-ldap-sync) developed by us enables a structured representation of LDAP entries in Zammad.
