**Testcontainers** is an open source framework for providing throwaway, lightweight instances of databases, message brokers, web browsers, or just about anything that can run in a Docker container.

We use [Testcontainers for Java](https://java.testcontainers.org/) when doing [in-house development](../publish.html) and having the need to provide a stable and reproducible testing environment when doing automated integration testing (e.g. data access layer integration tests).
