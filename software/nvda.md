**NVDA** (NonVisual Desktop Access) is a powerful open-source screenreader for Microsoft Windows that enables blind and visually impaired users to access digital content.

The LHM actively uses NVDA to test and optimize the accessibility of its software solutions. By integrating NVDA into the [development](../in-house-development.html) process, it ensures that accessible design is considered from the very beginning. This not only promotes the accessibility of its applications but also enhances the user experience for all citizens, regardless of their individual needs. Currently, the LHM has approximately 30-50 NVDA users.
