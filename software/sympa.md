__Sympa__ is a software program for managing mailing lists. 

---

Sympa enables the provision of centrally maintained distribution lists that can contain both internal and external email addresses.
Sympa offers a web interface to make managing distribution lists more convenient.

To ensure security, we commissioned an [external pentest for Sympa](/pentest/WASPT-Ergebnisbericht-Landeshaupstadt-Muenchen_Sympa-short-version-publishable_final.pdf).
